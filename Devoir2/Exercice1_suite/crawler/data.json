The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.

This is a <i>sleep</i> effect.</p><p><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.
